0.8.0
Not released yet
This version contains a working adlib emulator (from the chocolate-doom project), and audio is 
implemented. Various bugfixes.

0.7.0
23.10.11
This version contains a complete game engine, and should be almost identical to the original game.
This version doesn't support audio.

0.6.0
15.09.11
This snapshot is based on 0.4.0 (C code). What's new is a working game engine, made after deep
analysis of TTF's original game engine. The engine does appearently handle player, objects, gates
and elevators flawlessly. This snapshot is tested mostly with Titus, and it should handle Moktar as
well. What's remaining is the enemies, and the adlib audio.

0.5.0
Engine rewritten in C++, discontinued.

0.4.0
01.03.09
This is the first audio-enabled version. It can play amiga modules by now, by using LibMikMod or
SDL-mixer. I haven't looked at Atari and Amstrad yet. Adlib audio is difficult to achieve, because
a good adlib emulator is required. The best emulator by now is the MAME adlib emulator, but that is
covered by the MAME license, and thus makes it difficult to include in OpenTitus. Audio is
pauseable by using F3. LibMikMod can play music in the same process (which reduces the framerate to
8FPS), or it can play in a separate process (recommanded). SDL-mixer will also play music in a
separate process. It is possible to do some basic compile-time configuration by manually editing
config.h. I have added a very basic movement engine. This is the last version programmed in C. The
next will be C++. This version is also possible to load in NetBeans.

0.3.0
24.12.08
This version successfully loads the level in a TITUS_level structure and displays the levels by
reading from this structure. It is also possible to move titus "noclip" style to examine the levels.
What's left is animation and the movement engine, and music. The "levelviewer" executable is not
compatible with the new functions, and is simply skipped in the makefile. This will be the first
version on Sourceforge. This version also contains Jesses' documentations.

0.2.1
29.11.08
Jesse modified the makefile to compile all, and he confirmed that the project still compiled in
MinGW in windows, by using the makefile.

0.2
27.11.08
A snapshot. This is not a separate version because of an achieved goal, but to show the progress.
What's new is the "opentitus" executable. The source have a better structure now, and the main
functions should be easier to understand and debug. I have written a new function that extracts
the font used in the game, and correctly prints it on the screen. After some playing with alpha
(or transparency) settings and keyboard handling routines, I have successfully cloned the intro of
the game and the menu. To be specific: Intro text, titus logo, game image, menu, password prompting
and the pre-level screen. This game is now also fully functional with Moktar (by modifying the
titus.conf setting file). This snapshot also includes a level structure, which should make the game
quite configurable (extendable enemy-, object-, gate-, elevator- and bonus records count, and
extendable level width and height, and possibility to use custom sprites and background tiles with
custom size and bit depth). What the program misses now is the game engine and music. I haven't
made anything new regarding the level viewer, except cleaning the source file by moving functions
in separate source files. As usual, I have only compiled the source in Linux, so I can't guarantee
any windows functionality; however, Jesse told me that version 0.1 did compile successfully in MinGW.

0.1
16.11.08
First "official" version. The project isn't released to the public yet.
This version includes a program that extracts SQZ files, and a level viewer. This is not interactive;
only the upper left part of the level is displayed (read prior 0.1). The project also have a simple
config file, with possibilities to change resolution and video mode, and the location of the original
data files. This version is only compatible with Titus the Fox (Moktar doesn't work yet) in a Linux
environment.

Prior 0.1
22.09.08 - 15.11.08
The project starts with a function that extracts the SQZ files. Functions that extracts background
tiles, bonuses, elevators, enemies, objects and Titus himself is made, one by one, and finally this
is displayed on the screen using SDL, which results in version 0.1.
