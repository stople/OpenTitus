List of bugs in the original game + improvements to the original game engine
Can be fixed in new levels, but default is not fixed in the original levels


Bugs:

When bouncing on a skateboard on top of other objects, the player will drop through

When 2 balls are on top of each other, it's possible to jump through the ceiling
if there's 3 tiles between the floor and the ceiling (the secret chamber on level 2)

It's not possible to drop through the garbage bin (level 2)


Improvements:

When close to deadly spikes with an elevator above, below the player,
scroll so that both elevators and spikes are visible (level 9)
