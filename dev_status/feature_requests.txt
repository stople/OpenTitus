Make an independent "OpenTitus"-mode
The PC and Amiga games are different: Amiga looks better and easier than the PC version.
Thus: the OpenTitus version (toggleable with the PC version) should include stuff from the amiga version:
 - Should be included: Better scrolling
 - Should be included: Player becomes immortal a short time after getting hurt
 - Should be included: Fade in and out on level codes
 - Maybe: Include the level intro with lives that gets removed
 - Maybe: Modified levels: some enemies moves slower, and other things (the boss on 5th level)
 - Maybe: The gradient background instead of the sky with stars
 - Maybe: Keep amount of lives visible
 - Maybe: Sound effect on bounce
 - Maybe: Support for amiga sound effects
 - Doubtly: Make the ball become flat
Non-amiga improvements:
 - Health bar and amount of lives visible at all times (Blues Brothers / Super Mario)

Squeeze bugs also visible in the original game (original_bugs.txt)

Improve engine (original_bugs.txt) (all modifications must be toggleable!)
